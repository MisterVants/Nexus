/**
 A structure that references an image sprite in Data Dragon.
 
 An image sprite resource can be retrieved in two ways: By using the
 direct URL for a given resource or by retrieving its sprite sheet
 and locating the sprite by its frame.
 
 To request a sprite by its URL, you need to specify its group and
 filename as path components in a versioned image URL. The URL should
 be constructed as following:
 
 ````
 ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/{patch}/img/{group}/{filename}
 ````
 
 A sprite sheet can be retrived with the same URL scheme, located under
 the 'sprite' group and using the sprite sheet's name as the filename.
 The frame property should then be used to locate the sprite in the sheet.
 
 If you need to retrieve a large ammount of sprites, the second approach
 works best, as a single network call will retrieve multiple sprites of a
 category in a batch.
